# flake-hosts library implementation
#
# This file contains the core implementation of the flake-hosts library,
# which provides utilities for managing NixOS and Darwin system configurations
# in Nix flakes. It implements an "input-less" architecture pattern inspired
# by easy-hosts, allowing consuming flakes to control their own input versions.
#
# Key Features:
#   - Automatic host discovery from filesystem structure
#   - Flexible system/class/architecture resolution
#   - Class-specific module loading (nixos, darwin, home, nixOnDroid)
#   - Layered configuration system with shared, per-class, and per-arch configs
#   - Support for both explicit and auto-discovered host definitions
#   - Input-less architecture for maximum flexibility
#
# Architecture Overview:
#   The library is organized into several functional areas:
#   1. System Utilities: Handle system string parsing and resolution
#   2. Path Utilities: Implement filesystem discovery and path resolution
#   3. Module Loading: Load and resolve Nix modules from various sources
#   4. Host Building: Construct individual system configurations
#   5. Configuration Merging: Combine multiple configuration sources
#   6. Collection Processing: Handle bulk operations on host collections
#
# This file is designed to be imported by flake-module.nix and provides
# the core functions (mkHosts, buildHosts) used to implement the flake-parts module.

  # =============================================================================
  # SYSTEM UTILITIES
  # =============================================================================
  # These utilities handle the conversion between different system representations:
  # - system strings (e.g., "x86_64-linux", "aarch64-darwin")
  # - class + arch pairs (e.g., { class = "nixos"; arch = "x86_64"; })
  # They support the input-less architecture pattern by allowing flexible
  # system specification and automatic inference.

  # Constructs a Nix system string from architecture and class components.
  # This is the inverse operation of splitSystem and handles the mapping between
  # flake-hosts' semantic class names and Nix's system conventions.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   arch (string): System architecture ("x86_64", "aarch64", etc.)
  #   class (string): System class ("nixos", "darwin", "home", "nixOnDroid")
  #
  # Returns:
  #   string | null: Nix system string, or null for classes that don't need one
  #
  # Examples:
  #   constructSystem "x86_64" "nixos" => "x86_64-linux"
  #   constructSystem "aarch64" "darwin" => "aarch64-darwin"
  #   constructSystem "x86_64" "home" => null (home-manager doesn't use system)
  #
  # Related Functions:
  #   - Used by flake-module.nix to construct system strings for internal system option
  constructSystem = arch: class:
    if class == "darwin"
    then "${arch}-darwin"
    else if class == "nixos"
    then "${arch}-linux"
    else null; # home and nixOnDroid don't need system strings for their builders

  # Note: splitSystem function removed - no longer needed with internal system option

  # Note: resolveSystemConfig function removed - system is now computed in flake-module.nix

  # =============================================================================
  # PATH UTILITIES
  # =============================================================================
  # These utilities handle filesystem path resolution and module discovery.
  # They implement the auto-discovery logic that allows flake-hosts to
  # automatically find host configurations and class-specific modules
  # from standard directory structures.

  # Note: checkModulePath function removed - in Nix, paths can be:
  # - .nix files directly
  # - directories containing default.nix
  # Nix's import system handles this resolution automatically.

  # Finds the first existing path from a list of candidates.
  # Used for fallback path resolution when multiple standard locations
  # might contain the desired files (e.g., "./hosts" vs "./systems").
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   candidates (list of strings): Paths to check in order of preference
  #
  # Returns:
  #   string?: First existing path, or null if none exist
  #
  # Example:
  #   findFirstPath [ "./hosts" "./systems" ] => "./hosts" (if it exists first)
  findFirstPath = candidates: let
    existing = lib.filter pathExists candidates;
  in
    if existing == []
    then null
    else lib.head existing;

  # Infers standard filesystem paths from configuration with intelligent fallbacks.
  # This implements the "convention over configuration" approach - if paths aren't
  # explicitly specified, it searches for them in standard locations.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   cfg (attrset): The flake-hosts configuration from flake-module.nix
  #
  # Returns:
  #   { hostsDir: string?, modulesDir: string?, systemsFilter: list? }: Resolved paths
  #
  # Path Resolution Logic:
  #   - hostsDir: Explicit cfg.auto.hostsDir, or first of ["./hosts", "./systems"]
  #   - modulesDir: Explicit cfg.auto.modulesDir, or first of ["./modules", "./module", "./classes", "./class"]
  #   - systemsFilter: Copy of cfg.auto.systems for filtering built hosts
  #
  # Error Handling:
  #   - hostsDir is required when auto.enable=true, throws error if not found
  #   - modulesDir is optional, returns null if not found (disables class modules)
  #   - All paths return null when auto.enable=false
  #
  # This function bridges the gap between user configuration and internal path handling.
  inferPaths = cfg: {
    # Hosts directory is required for auto-discovery
    hostsDir =
      if cfg.auto.enable
      then
        (cfg.auto.hostsDir or (
          let
            found = findFirstPath ["./hosts" "./systems"];

            if found != null
            then found
            else throw "auto: no hosts directory found; set flake-hosts.auto.hostsDir or create ./hosts or ./systems"
        ))
      else null;

    # Modules directory is optional - null disables class-specific module loading
    modulesDir =
      if cfg.auto.enable
      then (cfg.auto.modulesDir or (findFirstPath ["./modules" "./module" "./classes" "./class"]))
      else null;

  # =============================================================================
  # MODULE LOADING
  # =============================================================================
  # These functions handle the discovery and loading of Nix modules from the filesystem.
  # They implement the class-specific module system that automatically loads
  # appropriate modules based on the host's class (nixos, darwin, home, nixOnDroid).
  # This reduces boilerplate by eliminating the need for manual perClass configuration.

  # Loads class-specific modules from the modulesDir directory.
  # This implements automatic module loading based on the host's class,
  # eliminating the need for manual perClass configuration in most cases.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   modulesDir (string?): Base directory containing class-specific modules
  #   class (string): Host class ("nixos", "darwin", "home", "nixOnDroid")
  #
  # Returns:
  #   { modules: list, specialArgs: attrset }: Module configuration for this class
  #
  # Discovery Logic:
  #   1. If modulesDir is null, return empty configuration (class modules disabled)
  #   2. Look for "${modulesDir}/${class}.nix" first (e.g., "./modules/nixos.nix")
  #   3. Fall back to "${modulesDir}/${class}" directory (e.g., "./modules/nixos/default.nix")
  #   4. If neither exists, return empty configuration (no class modules for this class)
  #
  # This function is called by mergeHostSources for every host to automatically
  # include class-appropriate modules without explicit configuration.
  #
  # Examples:
  #   - nixos host gets modules from "./modules/nixos.nix" or "./modules/nixos/"
  #   - darwin host gets modules from "./modules/darwin.nix" or "./modules/darwin/"
  #
  # Related Functions:
  #   - mergeHostSources: Calls this function to gather class-specific configuration
  #   - inferPaths: Determines the modulesDir directory from configuration
  loadClassModules = modulesDir: class: let
    resolved =
      if modulesDir == null
      then null
      else
        (
          let
            # Try .nix file first (e.g., "./modules/nixos.nix")
            # This pattern allows simpler organization for small class modules
            nixFile = "${modulesDir}/${class}.nix";
            # Fall back to directory (e.g., "./modules/nixos/default.nix")
            # This pattern supports complex class modules with multiple files
            nixDir = "${modulesDir}/${class}";
          in

  };

  # =============================================================================
  # HOST BUILDING
  # =============================================================================
  # These functions handle the construction of individual host configurations.
  # They bridge the gap between flake-hosts' high-level configuration and
  # the specific system builders (nixosSystem, darwinSystem, etc.) required
  # by each class. This includes setting up standard modules, special arguments,
  # and ensuring consistent behavior across all system types.

  # Selects the appropriate system builder function for a given host class.
  # Each class requires a different builder from its respective input,
  # with nixosSystem as the default fallback for the "nixos" class.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   class (string): Host class ("nixos", "darwin", "home", "nixOnDroid")
  #   inputs (attrset): Available flake inputs with their lib functions
  #
  # Returns:
  #   function: The appropriate system builder function
  #
  # Builder Mapping:
  #   - "darwin" -> nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem
  #   - "home" -> home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration
  #   - "nixOnDroid" -> nixOnDroid.lib.nixOnDroidConfiguration
  #   - "nixos" (and fallback) -> nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem
  #
  # Error Handling:
  #   - Throws descriptive errors if required inputs are missing
  #   - This ensures clear feedback when flake inputs aren't properly configured
  #
  # Note: This function implements the input-less architecture pattern by
  # accepting inputs as parameters rather than accessing them globally.
  #
  # Related Functions:
  #   - mkHost: Uses this function to get the appropriate system builder
  #   - makeStandardModules: Creates compatible modules for the selected builder

  # Generates the standard modules that all flake-hosts managed systems receive.
  # These modules provide consistent behavior across all host classes and handle
  # the integration between flake-hosts and the underlying system builders.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   name (string): Host name for networking configuration
  #   class (string): Host class for conditional module inclusion
  #   system (string?): Nix system string (null for classes that don't need it)
  #   nixpkgs (flake): Nixpkgs input for configuration
  #
  # Returns:
  #   list: List of NixOS/Darwin/Home-Manager modules
  #
  # Generated Modules:
  #   1. System-specific args: Provides self'/inputs' from withSystem (if system != null)
  #   2. Hostname: Sets networking.hostName with mkDefault priority
  #   3. Nixpkgs config: Configures hostPlatform and flake source (if system != null)
  #   4. Darwin nixpkgs: Additional Darwin-specific nixpkgs configuration
  #
  # Module Keys:
  #   All modules use "flake-hosts#..." keys to avoid conflicts with user modules.
  #   The _file attribute points to this lib.nix for debugging/tracing.
  #
  # Conditional Logic:
  #   - System-specific features only apply when system != null (excludes home/nixOnDroid)
  #   - Darwin gets additional nixpkgs.source configuration

  #   modules (list): Additional modules to include (default: [])
  #   specialArgs (attrset): Additional special arguments (default: {})
  #   ...args: Other arguments including potential input overrides
  #
  # Returns:
  #   Derivation: Built system configuration ready for deployment
  #
  # Module Assembly Logic:
  #   1. Host path modules: The host's main configuration file (if specified)
  #   2. Legacy path fallbacks: Check old standard locations for compatibility
  #   3. Standard modules: flake-hosts integration modules (hostname, nixpkgs, etc.)

  # =============================================================================
  # HOST CONFIGURATION MERGING
  # =============================================================================
  # These functions handle the complex logic of merging multiple configuration sources
  # for each host. This includes shared configuration, class-specific modules,
  # architecture-specific configuration, and automatic class modules.
  # The merging respects the "pure" flag to allow hosts to opt out of shared configuration.

  # Merges multiple configuration sources for a single host into a unified configuration.
  # This implements the layered configuration system that allows flexible host specification
  # while maintaining consistent behavior across similar hosts.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   hostConfig (attrset): Host-specific configuration (highest priority)
  #   sharedConfig (attrset): Shared configuration for all hosts (conditional)
  #   classConfig (attrset): Class-specific configuration (perClass function result)
  #   archConfig (attrset): Architecture-specific configuration (perArch function result)
  #   classModules (attrset): Auto-loaded class modules from filesystem
  #
  # Returns:
  #   { modules: list, specialArgs: attrset }: Merged configuration
  #
  # Merging Logic:
  #   1. Always include: hostConfig, classConfig, archConfig, classModules
  #   2. Conditionally include sharedConfig (skipped if hostConfig.pure = true)
  #   3. Modules are concatenated (later sources can override earlier ones)
  #   4. SpecialArgs are deeply merged with recursiveUpdate (later takes precedence)
  #
  # Pure Hosts:
  #   Hosts with `pure = true` skip shared configuration, allowing them to have
  #   completely independent configuration. This is useful for special-purpose
  #   hosts that shouldn't inherit common settings.
  #
  # This function is central to flake-hosts' configuration system, as it implements
  # the "convention over configuration" approach while still allowing full customization.

  # =============================================================================
  # HOST COLLECTION PROCESSING
  # =============================================================================
  # These functions handle the bulk processing of host collections, implementing
  # both explicit host definition (mkHosts) and automatic filesystem discovery (buildHosts).
  # They coordinate the various configuration sources and apply filtering/transformation
  # logic to produce the final host collections ready for system builders.

  # Helper function for merging attribute sets with the same structure.
  # Used to combine multiple host collections (e.g., nixosConfigurations, darwinConfigurations)
  # from different processing phases into a single unified collection.
  #
  # This is equivalent to: foldl' (acc: x: mergeAttrs acc x) {} listOfAttrsets
  # but more efficient for the common case of merging many attribute sets.
  foldAttrsMerge = foldAttrs mergeAttrs {};

  # Filters a host collection to only include hosts matching specified systems.
  # This implements the auto.systems filtering feature that allows users to build
  # only a subset of their configured hosts (e.g., only Linux or only Darwin).
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   systemsFilter (list?): List of system strings to include, or null for no filtering
  #   hosts (attrset): Host configurations to filter
  #
  # Returns:
  #   attrset: Filtered host configurations
  #
  # Filtering Logic:
  #   - If systemsFilter is null, return all hosts unchanged
  #   - For each host, check if its system string is in the systemsFilter list
  #   - Always include hosts with system=null (home/nixOnDroid) regardless of filter
  #
  # Use Cases:
  #   - CI/CD: Build only Linux systems on Linux runners
  #   - Development: Build only local architecture during development
  #   - Deployment: Build specific systems for particular deployment phases
  filterBySystem = systemsFilter: hosts:

  #   - archConfig: Result of cfg.perArch.${arch} function
  #   - classModules: Auto-loaded modules from modulesDir
  #   - sharedConfig: cfg.hosts.default (skipped if host is pure)

  # Processes hosts automatically discovered from filesystem structure.
  # This implements the "convention over configuration" approach where hosts
  # are inferred from directory/file structure rather than explicit configuration.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   cfg (attrset): Complete flake-hosts configuration from flake-module.nix
  #
  # Returns:
  #   attrset: Host configurations keyed by hostname, ready for further processing
  #
  # Discovery Logic:
  #   1. Read the hostsDir directory to find potential host files/directories
  #   2. Filter to valid entries (exclude special files, include .nix files and directories)
  #   3. Normalize names ("host.nix" -> "host", "host/" -> "host")
  #   4. Load configuration from each discovered path
  #   5. Apply system filtering if specified
  #
  # Supported Host Patterns:
  #   - "hostname.nix": Single file host configuration
  #   - "hostname/default.nix": Directory-based host configuration
  #   - Mixed: Some hosts as files, others as directories
  #
  # Exclusions:
  #   - "default" and "default.nix": Reserved for shared configuration
  #   - Non-.nix regular files: Not importable as Nix modules
  #
  # The result is a flat collection of host configurations that can be further
  # processed by mkHosts or used directly for building systems.
